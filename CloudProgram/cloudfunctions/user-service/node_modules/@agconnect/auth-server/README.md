## Overview

Most apps need to identify and authenticate users to tailor the app 
experience for individual users. However, building such a system from 
scratch is a difficult process. Auth Service can quickly build a secure 
and reliable user authentication system for your app. You only need to 
access Auth Service capabilities in your app without caring about the 
facilities and implementation on the cloud.
